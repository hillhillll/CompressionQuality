# CompressionQuality
This repository contains the scripts for the methods described in "Bo Ma, Susanne K. Suter, and Alireza Entezari. 2017. Quality assessment of volume compression approaches using isovalue clustering. Comput. Graph. 63, C (April 2017), 18-27. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2017.01.006".

## /Compression
This folder includes scripts for performing discrete wavelet transform, discrete cosine transform, and tensor approximation to volumetric datasets.

## /Quality_measures
This folder includes scripts for conventional assessments of volumetric data compressions including MSE, SNR, and SSIM.

## Structural volume quality assessment.
The scripts for selecting benchmark isovalues can be found at https://github.com/scumabo/TransferFunctionDVR/tree/master/FeatureClassification. The code for the perceptual-based mesh quality metric can be found in [2] at http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~kai.wang/publications_en.html.
